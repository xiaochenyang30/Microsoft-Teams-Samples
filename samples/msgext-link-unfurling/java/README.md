# Teams Link Unfurl Bot

Bot Framework v4 Teams [link unfurling](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/messaging-extensions/how-to/link-unfurling?tabs=json) bot sample for Teams.

This bot has been created using [Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com), it shows how to create a simple bot that performs link unfurling in Teams.

This sample is a Spring Boot app and uses the Azure CLI and azure-webapp Maven plugin to deploy to Azure.

- **Interaction with Messaging Extension Link Unfurling**
![MsgExtLink](Images/LinkUnfurling.gif)

## Prerequisites
- Intall Java 1.8+ [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java8-windows)
- Install [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
- Setup for Java and Maven [Setup](Setup.md)
- An account on [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com) if you want to deploy to Azure.
- Microsoft Teams is installed and you have an account
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) or equivalent tunnelling solution

## Setup

> Note these instructions are for running the sample on your local machine, the tunnelling solution is required because
the Teams service needs to call into the bot.

1) Run ngrok - point to port 3978

    ```bash
    ngrok http --host-header=rewrite 3978
    ```

1) Setup for Bot

   In Azure portal, create a [Azure Bot resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-quickstart-registration).
    - For bot handle, make up a name.
    - Select "Use existing app registration" (Create the app registration in Azure Active Directory beforehand.)
    - __*If you don't have an Azure account*__ create an [Azure free account here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/)

   In the new Azure Bot resource in the Portal, 
    - Ensure that you've [enabled the Teams Channel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/channel-connect-teams?view=azure-bot-service-4.0)
    - In Settings/Configuration/Messaging endpoint, enter the current `https` URL you were given by running ngrok. Append with the path `/api/messages`

1) Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples.git
    ```

1) Update the `resources/application.properties` configuration for the bot to use the Microsoft App Id and App Password from the Bot Framework registration. (Note the App Password is referred to as the "client secret" in the azure portal and you can always create a new client secret anytime.)

1) From the root of this project folder: (`samples/msgext-link-unfurling/java`)
    - Open a terminal and build the sample using `mvn package` command
    - Install the packages in the local cache by using `mvn install` command in a terminal
    - Run it by using `java -jar .\target\bot-teams-link-unfurl-sample.jar` command in a terminal

1) __*This step is specific to Teams.*__
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` contained in the `teamsAppManifest` folder to replace your Microsoft App Id (that was created when you registered your bot earlier) *everywhere* you see the place holder string `<<YOUR-MICROSOFT-APP-ID>>` (depending on the scenario the Microsoft App Id may occur multiple times in the `manifest.json`)
    - **Zip** up the contents of the `TeamsAppManifest` folder to create a `manifest.zip` (Make sure that zip file does not contains any subfolder otherwise you will get error while uploading your .zip package)
    - **Upload** the `manifest.zip` to Teams (In Teams Apps/Manage your apps click "Upload an app". Browse to and Open the .zip file. At the next dialog, click the Add button.)

## Running the sample

> Note the Teams `manifest.json` for this sample also includes a Search Query. This Messaging Extension is only introduced in order to enable installation, because there is no mechanism for installing a link unfurling feature in isolation.

If you copy and paste a link from https://www.BotFramework.com into the compose message area the link will unfurl.
